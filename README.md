# NFC Projects
Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸš€

This repository contains a series of projects and experiments based on NFC (Near Field Communication) technology. My work explores various applications of this technology, ranging from process automation to creating innovative solutions for wireless short-range interactions.

## Main Projects
ðŸ”‘ The goal is to use NFC technology to create interactive and immersive experiences around creature management, combining dynamic data stored on NFC cards and static information accessible via an API. The projects aim to explore the use of NFC in games and mobile applications, as well as virtual collection management. Here are some of the objectives:

* Creature Combat Game: Develop an interactive combat system where each creature has dynamic characteristics stored on NFC cards, enabling physical interactions between players and their creatures.
* Creature Collection: Create a mobile app to read NFC card data for collecting and managing creatures, with a simple and engaging interface.
* Creature Directory: Build a website that lists all available creatures, offering detailed information and allowing users to track their collection.

## My Modules
* Web API: An ASP.NET Web API that manages the static data of creatures, such as types, characteristics, and game rules.
* NFC Card: Each creature is associated with an NFC card that stores dynamic information (health points, attacks, etc.). The cards allow physical interaction with creatures in the game or adding them to a collection via a simple NFC scan.
* Portal: A physical device made up of an Arduino board and a PN532 module, designed to read and write data on NFC cards. This portal connects NFC cards to devices and ensures the management of dynamic data during battles or collection activities.

## Technologies Used
* NFC (Near Field Communication): A short-range wireless communication standard.
* Arduino: Platforms used for prototyping NFC systems.
* Android: For developing mobile apps leveraging NFC technology.
* C#, C++, Java: Programming languages used for creating scripts and interfaces.
